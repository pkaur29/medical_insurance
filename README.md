## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts medical insurance costs based on a variety of input features. The prediction model can assist insurance companies and customers in estimating insurance premiums more accurately, allowing for better decision-making and financial planning.

## Features

- Input Features: Age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, etc.
- Target Variable: Medical insurance cost.
- Model Used:Linear Regression,Logistic Regression,KNN,Decision Tree,Naive Bayes,Random Forest
- Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, etc.

##Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains records of individuals and their respective insurance costs. It includes the following features:

- Age: Age of the individual
- Sex:Gender of the individual (Male/Female)
- BMI:Body Mass Index
-Children: Number of children covered by the insurance
- Smoker: Smoking status (Yes/No)
- Region:Residential region (e.g., Northeast, Southeast, etc.)
- Charges:Medical insurance cost (Target variable)




## Model Performance

The model was trained and evaluated using the following metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE):[MAE Score]
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):[RMSE Score]
R-squared:** [R-squared Score]
